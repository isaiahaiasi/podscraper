# TODO
basically all I want is to make a table for the pod data & a folder full of mp3s
[x] - get links to each podcast episode page
    (pretty sure site/###/ works--just needs leading 0s)
[x] - for each podcast episode page, grab the data I want
    - at least the mp3 url
    - might also want meta data to construct an rss feed.
    - in that case, compare w current rss & try to find equivalents in the html
      - title
      - description
      - guests
      - (not sure about timestamps!)
[ ] - download the media (tbh I can probably stop here)
[ ] - write a script to take the data & turn it into an RSS feed
